## Summary
This is a series of scripts utilizing Whisper AI to transcribe multi-channel discord audio. I was using Craig for discord transcription and downloading multi-track .flac files.

There will need to be some modifications for single track files and there won't be any speaker identification.

## Setup
Requires at least python 3.11, and pytorch libraries. Be sure to install CUDA supported libraries if your graphics card supports CUDA.
